# README



Welcome to Gigly.io.  

Gigly.io is an interactive web application where project creators and artists come together to collaborate on awesome projects.  
Visitors of the site (potential new creators and artists) can browse and search the site to see the available artists and projects.
If they want to create or be part of a project a user would then need to sign up and login to access the website's services.  As a
creator user, you should be able to sign up and login using a unique email.  Once you are logged in to the website, you can then
edit your profile (name, password, bio, profile picture) and create projects.  There is a delete option, but we hope all our members
stay with us for the long run as our service is free.  Once a creator user creates a project, they then can proceed to use the search
function to browse, contact and hire artists for their project(s).  Upon completion of the project, the creator can rate and review 
the artists of their projects.  Hopefully in the near future, we can implement the option for a user sign in as a creator 
or an artist. 

Happy gigging to all our members.
